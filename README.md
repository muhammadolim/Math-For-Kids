## Motivation
I build this app to help my little sister to do better in her math class. And She became very good at adding and subtracting numbers below 100 over time. It was interesting as well as very useful project and we have enjoyed a lot together!
## About
You will be given 21 simple addition and subtraction problems only including 2 digit numbers. Even if you add two numbers answer will not be greater than 99. It is because these exercises are for 2-3 grade pupils. Subtracting two numbers will not cause negative number also.
When you finish solving all given problems there will appear your score and related motivation sentence.
There is also a timer on the top right corner that is another beneficial feature to use.
## Future ideas
- add multiplication and division problems
- able to choose number of problems
- add restart button
- add login
- keep track of scores of users
- do responsive
